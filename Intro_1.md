### Intro to open source

<summary><h2></h2></summary>

Welcome to Introduction to Open Source!

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you some of the concepts surrounding "open source" and how the platform GitHub is used to support those concepts. You will also learn some basic workflows using the GitHub platform.

This tutorial is part of a larger series of tutorials created to teach J&J statistical programmers how to use open source, Git, GitHub, and RStudio together.

<summary><h2>But why?</h2></summary>

### Now why are we doing this? 

J&J is committed to the use and development of R products and packages for the analysis of clinical and pre-clinical data. Hopefully, some of you have already started to experiment with R and are interested in using it for your analyses. 

Implementing R will expand our analysis capabilities. Contributing to the development of packages with open source will cement J&J's footprint in the standardization of analyses and outputs, and help guide the future of analysis and statistical tools across the industry.

<summary><h2>Definitions</h2></summary>

### Let's pause for a second and add some definitions. What is open source?
  
From [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
"Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code,[1] design documents,[2] or content of the product. The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.[3][4] A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in open-source appropriate technology,[5] and open-source drug discovery.[6][7]"

### So what does that mean to us?
  
It means that we can collaborate with not just our own team and our own company, but other teams from other companies. Sharing interest, intent and effort with many people will hopefully lead to better tools. 

### Using a platform like Github gives us a tool to facilitate this work with others.

### Let's talk about Git and GitHub. What are they?

**What is Git?**
Git is a version control system. What is version control? It is the the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are applications that allow us to track these changes. 

Here are a few references if you would like to read further..

**What is GitHub?**: GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. What does that mean? Well, it provides cloud based storage for your repositories, and it provides a platform for sharing and interacting with them. And it uses [Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git) for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to [open-source](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source) software.

<summary><h2>Create Account</h2></summary>

### Please create your account

Github has a wealth of resources, and we are going to leverage some of those for our introduction. However, before we do we need to be able to operate on the GitHub platform which means we need an account. Please go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and register for a new account if you do not already have one. A few tips from [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) regarding username:

* Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
* Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
* Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
* Shorter is better than longer.
* Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
* Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.
* Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming. In my first inept efforts to script around the GitHub API, I assigned lots of issues to the guy with username NA because my vector of GitHub usernames contained missing values. A variant of Little Bobby Tables.
* Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen -.

<summary><h2>First Exercise</h2></summary>

Let's start with the first tutorial/exercise. (You have already watched the first video). Please follow the steps outlined in this tutorial, and then return here. This should take less than an hour, but please ask questions if you get stuck. See you soon!

<summary><h2>Extra Practice</h2></summary>

Welcome back. Hopefully you now have an idea on how to add something to GitHub.. 

### Extra practice
If you would like some extra practice- repeat some of the steps that you learned through the tutorial; but this time, generate your own work. If you need help use the tutorial as a reference.

* Go to your home page on GitHub, and generate a new repository. Be sure to include a Readme file. 
* Name it something unique
* Open and edit the Readme file. Add an image if you want. 
* Commit your changes

<summary><h2>Intro to Markdown</h2></summary>

### Markdown
We are now going to go through a tutorial on Markdown. Markdown is a language used to format text documents. It is useful for communication and organization. All of the tutorial documents for this course have been generated with Markdown. If you would like to dig deeper you can go [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Here is a tutorial that will get you started using Markdown with Github: [Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)




All finished? Nice work! Please note that using Markdown within GitHub provides a place and a medium for organization and communication. As you learned in the tutorial this might take the form of an outline or a to do list, or it might take the form of a set of instructions- like the ones you are reading right now. Either way, it is simple and central, which makes it convenient for us to use.
