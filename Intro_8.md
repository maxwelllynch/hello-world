<summary><h2>Branching strategies</h2></summary>

### Here are some thoughts and tips on branching:

1. Software development strategy is usually to create your branches per feature, or to fix a bug.
2. When using GitHub for data analysis it may make more sense to create a development branch or a branch for 1 part of the analysis of a specific study or experiment. 
3. DO create a branch that is specific: "boxplot_dev", "graph_ggplot," or "data_cleaning."
3. Do NOT create a branch per your name, like Josh_dev
4. Delete your branches after you have merged pull requests and integrated your code into main. 
5. Keep your branches organized. Make their names specific so that you (or someone else) know what they are for.

<summary><h2>Best Practices</h2></summary>

Here is a collection of best practices for working with Git and GitHub.

1. Avoid committing directly to main. Whenever possible, do your development and testing in a branch. 
2. Commit often. This decreases the risk that you will lose work should something happen to your computer etc. 
3. If you are working with others be sure to pull often. Make sure you have everyone else's up to date work. 
4. Communicate and collaborate. Working with others spreads the effort and usually leads to better ideas. Communicate when collaborating. Stating expectations, communicating issues etc makes everything work more smoothly. 
5. Ask for help. Spend a little time trying to problem-solve yourself and then seek the aid of someone qualified. 
6. Do not force push. Like ever.
