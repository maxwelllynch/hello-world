<summary><h2>Introduction</h2></summary>

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you some basic workflows using the GitHub platform.

This tutorial is part of a larger series of tutorials created to teach J&J statistical programmers how to use open source, GitHub, and RStudio together.

### Let's talk about branches

* GitHub allows us to create a copy of a repository, called a branch. 
* You can think of the structure like of a tree. The original branch, or trunk of the tree is usually called the "main" branch. 
* We can use the "branch" of a repository to test new code. This may be a feature for a software package or it may be script development for analysis. 
* Using the branch for development allows us to make changes while not corrupting the "main" or functional branch.
* We will go into more detail regarding branches and branching strategies in a later tutorial. 
* More on [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).

### Create a branch
Now that you have a rough understanding of what a branch is used for, let's create one. 

1. Please go back to the repo you created in tutorial #1. 
2. Select the button that says, "Main" under the menu
3. Type "Test Branch" in the dialog box that has appeared. 
4. Select the button that says, "Create Test Branch from Main"
5. Voila, you have created your first branch!

<summary><h2>Pull requests</h2></summary>

### Pull requests
* Now that you have learned about branches and how to use them, we are going to add in the idea of a pull request. 
* Unlike the branch of a tree, which never returns to the trunk, we can reconnect our branch to the main branch with something called a pull request. 
* Once the code in a branch is tested, and the owner feels that it is ready to be deployed, it can be merged back into the main branch with a pull request. 
* The next GitHub tutorial will teach you how to do that.. Here you go: [Creating a pull request](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests)

### Next steps:

Please inquire if you have co-workers from J&J taking this class. If not you can use one of the following names: lynch-j, 

* Go back to your own repository that now has a branch called "Test Branch." 
* Make sure that the branch drop down says "Test Branch." If it says "Main," change branches via the drop down.
* Open and edit your Readme, then hit commit.
* Open a pull request and assign your J&J buddy as a reviewer
* Your buddy will leave a review, and may suggest some changes
* Review the changes, make them, and then merge the pull request.

<summary><h2>A note regarding default branch names</h2></summary>

The default main branch of a repository in GitHub is now called "Main." Until recently, it was called "Master." Because this word can be considered offensive, a decision was made use a more neutral term. See [this](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/) for more info.

### **Great work**
Nice job getting this far. You are laying a good foundation for using GitHub, we will continue to build upon that.
