We can use issues in GitHub to facilitate development. We can request updates and identify problems just to mention a couple tasks. We are going to keep this relatively simple, but you can find extensive functionality descriptions in the resources. Read more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).

2. Under your repository name, click "Issues."
3. Click New issue.
4. click Open a blank issue. (Notice that there are options such as reporting a bug)

6. Click "Submit new issue"
7. Done!

Feel free to scroll down, and note that there are additional options. You can create issues from other applications, from comments, and you can use them to track work. That's all beyond the scope of our tutorials, but please note that you have lots of options!
